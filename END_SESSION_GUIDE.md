# End Session Feature for Medical Consultations ðŸ©º

This guide explains the new "End Session" feature that allows doctors to properly end consultation sessions.

## Overview

The "End Session" feature allows medical professionals to:

1. **Mark consultations as completed** in the database
2. **Send a final system message** to the client
3. **Archive the chat** so it appears in the "Completed Consultations" section

## How It Works

### For Doctors:

1. During an active consultation, doctors will see a three-dot menu (â‹®) in the top right corner of the chat
2. Clicking this menu shows an "End Session" option
3. Upon selection, a confirmation dialog appears to prevent accidental session endings
4. After confirmation, the consultation is marked as completed, and a system message appears in the chat

### For Clients:

1. Clients will see a system message: "The doctor has ended this consultation session. Thank you for using our service."
2. The chat will be moved to the "Completed Consultations" section
3. Clients can still view the chat history but cannot send new messages

## Technical Implementation

The feature was implemented with:

1. **Database Changes**:
   - Added `is_active` boolean column to `chats` table
   - Added `completed_at` timestamp column to `consultations` table
   - Created `end_consultation_session` database function

2. **UI Components**:
   - Added dropdown menu in the chat header (for doctors only)
   - Added confirmation dialog to prevent accidental endings
   - Added "Completed Consultations" section in the chat list

3. **New API Functions**:
   - `endConsultationSession()` in `consultationUtils.ts`
   - Checks to verify the user is a doctor

## Testing the Feature

To test the feature:

1. Login as a doctor
2. Open an active consultation chat
3. Click the three-dot menu and select "End Session"
4. Confirm the action in the dialog
5. Verify:
   - A system message appears in the chat
   - The chat moves to "Completed Consultations" section
   - The consultation status is updated in the database

## Benefits

This feature provides several benefits:

1. **Clear Session Boundaries**: Both doctors and clients know when a consultation officially ends
2. **Better Organization**: Completed consultations are separated from active ones
3. **Record Keeping**: All consultation chats are preserved for reference
4. **Billing Clarity**: Helps define when a billable consultation period ends

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for this feature:

1. Allow doctors to add custom end messages
2. Implement session duration tracking and billing
3. Enable follow-up appointment scheduling when ending sessions
4. Add ratings/feedback collection after session ends
